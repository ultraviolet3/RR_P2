Reproducible Research Peer Assessment 2- Events data

The Storm data contained duplicate, mis-spelt and acronyms for event types. This could cause the data set to be distored. 

Ther events data is a custom mapping of events described in the Storm Documentation to the event types recorded in the Storm database in an attempt to standardize the event types and to eliminate duplicates and mis-spelt event types.
